# rxjs-invaders

A primitive [RxJS](http://reactivex.io/rxjs/) based [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) type
game as outlined in [Reactive Programming with RxJS](https://pragprog.com/book/smreactjs/reactive-programming-with-rxjs)
written by [Sergi Mansilla](https://sergimansilla.com).

#### Motivation
Programming a Space Invaders like game seems to be the [TodoMV](http://todomvc.com) app of the [functional reactive
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) world, so I had to try messing with one too.

It is really nothing of interest to others.
